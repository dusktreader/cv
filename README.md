## Professional Experience

### Office Ally: 2019 -- Present: Web Development Team Lead

#### 2020 -- Present: Genomics Project & Transition to Team Lead

* Piloted effort to integrate lab reports and processing statuses from genomic testing
  venture project into Patient Ally.
* Collaborated with Architecture team to develop a kafka-based event driven architecture
  for moving genomics related data and status changes throughout cross-platform ecosystem.
* Revised Sprint Retrospective meeting structure to improve team engagement, encourage
  reflection on team dynamics, and promote positive feedback among team-members.
* Handled challenging transition to Team Lead in the midst of dramatic turnover,
  performance challenges, and team re-direction.
* Codified and regularized One-on-One meetings with direct reports to track professional
  development and establish constructive candor in team communication.
* Rallied an exhausted and discouraged team around a last minute crunch-time project
  mandated by high-level stakeholders and delivered results while maximizing engagement.

#### 2019 -- 2020: Patient Portal Frontend Rewrite

* Lead effort to rewrite legacy frontend application from Django to Angular 11 using
  modern best practices and reactive user experience
* Introduced [ngrx](https://ngrx.io/) store for system-wide application state management
  and reactive asynchronous communication with backend subsystems.
* Re-designed PA Messaging section from scratch to behave like familar email applications
  including contacts, attachments, and intuitive conversation-based message presentation.
* Promoted version control workflow standardization and collaborated with other senior
  developers to codify standards and best practices for git.
* Mentored junior devs struggling with new technologies and reactive design to improve
  overall team velocity in conversion project.


### Comscore: 2012 -- 2019: Senior Software Engineer

#### 2016 -- 2019: Cross-platform record linkage / entity resolution for large metadata store

* Spearheaded and lead development of mission critical internal system for record
  linkage and entity resolution (deduplicating and disambiguating metadata) from
  disparate subsystems of Comscore.
* Developed flexible graph-like data schema in Postgres to support heterogeneous data
  models in a single large metadata store.
* Architected ETL pipeline to consume and normalize multi-format data from a wide range
  of sources including S3, FTP, and external databases.
* Designed scalable recommendation engine using Spark for distributed processing to
  deliver aggregated link recommendations utilizing multiple, independent matching
  algorithms.
* Forged stand-alone API application using Python and Flask to service front-end UI as
  well as direct access by external services.


#### 2012 -- 2016: Refactor legacy record linkage systems

* Launched efforts to consolidate several mechanisms of ‚Äútitle matching‚Äù (human curated
  record linkage driven by algorithmic heuristics) for the On Demand Essentials product.
* Designed modular, data-driven subsystem to centralize record linkage and facilitate
  rapid deployment of new heuristic algorithms.
* Extended logging and event bookkeeping to support forensic analysis of failure events.
* Ported new MCP subsystem from On Demand Essentials to Digital Download Essentials
  creating a reusable code base that could be extended to similar products.
* Orchestrated crisis management effort for the new subsystem when a major data-provider
  began delivering invalid data, and used new capabilities to triage problems.


### Batelle Inc.: 2008 -- 2012: Applied Parallel Computing Scientist II

#### 2011 -- 2012: Modernize open-source biomolecular research application

* Anchored modernization team for
  [open-source biomolecular software project](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs)
  funded by National Institute of Health.
* Translated extensive legacy FORTRAN 77 computing backend into equivalent-performance
  ANSI C with custom minimal object oriented abstraction layer.
* Commuted entire project from Subversion version control system to Git to improve
  management and re-integration of exploratory source-code branches.
* Converted build system from Autotools to Cmake to improve stability and flexibility of
  build system while reducing overhead and improving maintainability of build scripts.


#### 2010 -- 2011:  Human tracking in gigapixel video streams of high-traffic environments

* Collaborated with premier university research team specializing in computer vision.
* Converged with two off-team developers to transition exploratory research code written
  in MatLab to deployment ready platform implemented in C++.
* Designed distributed computing platform for computational tasks including a
  dispatching system for client requests from a custom Qt client-side application to a
  compute cluster using ZeroMQ for low-latency inter-process communication.


#### 2008 -- 2010:  Detection and classification of objects in gigapixel images

* Researched and developed object detectors that hunted for ~2500 pixel objects in ~10
  gigapixel images utilizing OpenMP to locally optimize searches.
* Experimented with signature-based classifiers for disjoint object categories using
  Boosted Tree Classifiers, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks.
* Explored signature generation in C++ with OpenCV using morphology, curvature metrics,
  and structural statistical moments.
* Developed a novel hybridization of  a Self-Organizing Map with an Artificial Neural
  Network to classify images by structural signature of sub-features.


## Education

### 2004 -- 2008:  Washington State University: Computer Science B.S.

* Graduated Cum Laude
* Focused on Scientific Computing, Machine Learning, and Parallel Computing
