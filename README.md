  linkage and entity resolution (deduplicating and disambiguating metadata) from
  disparate subsystems of Comscore.
* Developed flexible graph-like data schema in [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) to
  support heterogeneous data models in a single large metadata store.
* Architected ETL pipeline to consume and normalize multi-format data from a wide range
  of sources including S3, FTP, and external databases.
